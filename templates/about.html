          <h2>Meet Pia Lokkevik</h2>
          <p>With over 10 years of experience teaching IGCSE subjects, Pia has developed a unique methodology that helps students grasp difficult concepts quickly and effectively.</p>
          <p>After working with hundreds of students and seeing the same struggles again and again, Pia created PLCC to provide targeted support for exam preparation. Her approach combines personalized attention with structured study methods that have proven successful across all 15 IGCSE subjects.</p>
          <p>Pia's students consistently improve their grades by at least two levels, often going from failing to achieving A* grades in just a few months.</p>
